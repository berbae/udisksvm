The 'udisksvm' and 'traydvm' scripts operate between udisks2 and a window
manager with a mouse and a system tray available. They listen to events and act
accordingly with removable media.
The 'traydvm' GUI utility displays a systray icon showing a plugged-in device,
with a right-click menu to perform actions on it.
The icon represents a file system/partition on the disk; so if there are
several partitions, there are one icon for each file system on them.
With a MBR partition table, only primary partitions are managed presently.

					          notification

The automounting feature is disabled by default.
It can be enabled for non-optical disks with the '-a', '--auto' command line
option.
The old '-n', '--noauto' option is still recognized but not used anymore.

A notification pops up after a 'Mount' or 'Unmount' action  by the right-click
menu.
This feature is enabled by default, and can be disabled by the '-s',
'--silent' command line option.

In its present form there are only three actions : 'Mount', 'Unmount', 'Eject'
The 'Mount' action operates on data optical disks, and on block devices with
plain partitions, ie not a container of other partitions or not contained in
another partition.
The 'Eject' action is only activated for an unmounted optical disk.
And only one CD/DVD drive at /dev/sr0 is considered.

The tooltip when the mouse pointer hovers over the icon gives the device name
and the folder name, normally in /run/media/<user_name>, where the mounted
media can be accessed in a file manager.

The 'traydvm' utility has no configuration file: the popup menu and the actions
are predefined in the script.

The 'udisksvm' and 'traydvm' scripts use the UDisks2 DBus API.
If used in a systemd configuration (default in Arch Linux) they also need to
be ran in an active systemd-logind session:

        loginctl show-session $XDG_SESSION_ID

should have a line with 'Active=yes'

For example, in Openbox and Tint2 with systray enabled, only add this line in
$HOME/.config/openbox/autostart to launch udisksvm with default options and
without text output:

	udisksvm >/dev/null &

To see output and errors from the script, run it in a console without the
redirection to /dev/null;
for more verbosity, run it with the '-d' or '--debug' option.

The file system types and mount options are controlled by UDisks2.
UDisks2 is rather restrictive presently:
'flush' is available for 'vfat' file system,
'sync' for 'ext2' file system.
These options are included in the scripts.

The traydvm script ignores all changes made to partitions or file
system types or label, while it is running; if such changes are made
on a device, while traydvm is running on it, the device has first to be
plugged out/in to re-launch traydvm on it.

These scripts can be extended to develop a more complete management of
removable media in a GUI oriented approach.
But they can simply be used as is, to automount, unmount or re-mount a USB
memory stick or an external disk, or for accessing data on optical CD/DVD
disks, only with mouse clicks.

They can also be used to only show system tray icons, with other tools to do
automounting or manual mounting/unmounting.
