The 'udisksvm' and 'traydvm' scripts operate between udisks and a window
manager with a mouse and a system tray available. They listen to events and act
accordingly with removable media.
The 'traydvm' GUI utility is a script which displays a systray icon showing a
plugged-in device, with a right-click menu to perform actions on it.

            automounting                        right-click menu
       (non optical disks only)                        |
                                                       |
                                                       V
					    commands to device media

The automounting feature is set by default, but only for non-optical disks.
That can be disabled with the '-n', '--noauto' command line option.

In its present form there are only three actions : 'Mount', 'Unmount', 'Eject'
The 'Mount' action operates on devices with one partition,
The 'Eject' action is only activated for an unmounted optical disk
(in UDisks2 there is no 'unmount' option for it).

The tooltip when the mouse pointer hovers over the icon gives the folder,
normally in /run/media/<user_name>, where the media can be accessed, when
mounted, in a file manager.

The 'traydvm' utility has no configuration file: the popup menu and the actions
are predefined in the script.

The 'udisksvm' and 'traydvm' scripts use the UDisks2 DBus API;
so THEY NEED DBUS RUNNING, and UDisks2 installed.

For example, in Openbox and Tint2 with systray enabled, only add this line in
$HOME/.config/openbox/autostart to launch udisksvm without any output:

	udisksvm >/dev/null &

To see output and errors from the script, run it in a console without the
redirection to /dev/null;
to have more verbosity, run it with the '-d' or '--debug' option.

The file system types and mount options are predefined, and UDisks2 doesn't
permit much choices presently: only 'flush' is available for 'vfat' file system
and almost nothing, other than defaults, for other types.
These file system types and options are written/coded in the two scripts
'udisksvm' and 'traydvm'.

This approach can be considered a starting point to a more complete management
of removable media in a GUI oriented approach.
But it can also be used as is, to simply automount, unmount or re-mount,
for example, a USB memory stick or an external disk, or for accessing data on
optical CD/DVD disks, only with mouse clicks.
