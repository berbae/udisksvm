The udisksvm script operates between udisks and a window manager with a mouse and a system tray available.
It listens to uevents and if the conditions are met it mounts a removable media and passes the control to Traydevice in the GUI.
Traydevice is a little desktop application displaying systray icon and allowing to execute custom commands on the specified device.
It can be find in the Arch User Repository (AUR) : https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=32005

					    commands to device media

In its present form it is simple and it only manages un-mounting/re-mounting of removable devices or eject optical disks, using only mouse clicks.
The text tip when the mouse pointer is on the systray icon gives the folder in /media where the media can be accessed in a file manager.

But other commands could be added in the default.xml configuration file of traydevice on more complicated conditions.

!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
! BEFORE USING THE SCRIPT the configuration file for traydevice MUST BE COPIED INTO $HOME/.config/traydevice directory : !
!                                                                                                                        !
!	install -D -m 644 /usr/share/udisksvm/default.xml $HOME/.config/traydevice/default.xml                           !
!                                                                                                                        !

The script works without hal but IT NEEDS DBUS RUNNING.
So dbus should be present in the DAEMONS line of /etc/rc.conf file.

Here is an example of using it with Openbox WM and Tint2 with systray enabled.

To initiate a ConsoleKit session and a dbus instance, Openbox is started with :

	exec ck-launch-session dbus-launch openbox-session

In $HOME/.config/openbox/autostart.sh these lines are needed :

	# Detection of insertion of an optical disk
	if ! pgrep -lf "udisks-daemon: polling /dev/sr0"; then
	    udisks --poll-for-media /dev/sr0
	fi

	udisksvm >/dev/null &

The automount options in udisksvm script can be changed, and other file system types can be added with specific options as well.
These file system types and options for mounting should be reported in the default.xml file of traydevice,
for it to correctly mount the devices in its right-click menu.

This method can be considered as a starting point to a more complete management of removable media in a GUI oriented approach.
But it can be used as is, to simply manage automounting, un-mounting and re-mounting of, for example, mass storage USB devices,
or for accessing data on optical CD/DVD disks.
